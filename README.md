# algo_notes
Algorithm practice and arrangement
This repository is a collection of my algorithm practice problems and notes.  
## Goals

- Solve at least 3â€“5 problems per week
- Review and reflect on each problem
- Build reusable templates for dynamic programming, binary search, etc.
- Track progress over time

## Notes

You can find my explanations and reusable code patterns in the `/notes` folder.  
Topics covered include:

- Recursion & Backtracking
- Greedy Strategies
- Dynamic Programming (0/1 Knapsack, LIS, etc.)
- Binary Search Template
- Tree & Graph Traversal

## Tools

- Language: Python / C++
